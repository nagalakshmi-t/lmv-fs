            <h2>All About Health Insurance Policy</h2>
            <h4>TYPES OF HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS IN INDIA</h4>
            <p><b>Hospitalization Plans:</b>
                Hospitalization plans are those health insurance plans that reimburse the hospitalization 
                and medical costs of an individual, subject to the sum insured. Hence, these plans are also
                known as indemnity plans. 
            </p>
            <p><b>Family floater Plans:</b>
                Family health insurance plans cover the entire family in one health insurance plan. It works 
                under the assumption that not all members of a family will suffer from illness at one time. 
                These plans cover hospital-related expenses which can be pre and post hospitalization. Most
                health insurance companies in India offering family insurance have a wide network of hospitals 
                that help the insured people in times of an emergency.
            </p>
            <p><b>Senior Citizens Plans:</b>
                As the name suggests, senior citizen health insurance plans are for the older people of the family.
                These plans cover health issues arising during old age. As per IRDAI guidelines, each insurer must 
                provide cover up to age of 65 years.
            </p>
            <p><b>Maternity Plans: </b>
                Maternity health insurance plans provide coverage for maternity and other additional expenses. These 
                policies take care of both pre and post-natal care, and delivery of baby i.e. normal or caesarean 
                deliveries. Just like other health insurance plans, the maternity insurance providers usually have a
                wide range of network hospitals and also takes care of ambulance expenses.
            </p>
            <p><b>THospital Daily Cash Benefit Plans- </b>
                Hospital Daily cash benefits is a defined benefit policy that provides a certain sum of money for every day of hospitalization.
            </p>
            <p><b>Critical Illness Plans:</b>
                These plans are benefit-based policies, where a lump sum benefit amount is paid on diagnosis of covered 
                critical illness. These diseases are usually specific, with high severity and low frequency in nature.
                Hence, the treatment cost is high when compared to day to day medical / treatment need. Some of these
                illnesses include heart attack, cancer, stroke etc.

                probability, pre-existing medical conditions are not covered under medical insurance plans. However, health insurance providers 
                have started providing coverage for pre-existing medical conditions after a waiting period ranging between two to four years.
            </p>
            <p><b>Pre-Existing Diseases:</b>
                In case you are suffering from any illnesses or health conditions before buying a health insurance plan, are known as pre-existing
                diseases. Usually, every health insurance company has a waiting period of 2-4 years or more that would roughly depend upon the type
                of disease as well as the risk in case your health insurer agrees to cover it. Certain pre-existing health conditions such as 
                cataract, few chronic diseases, joints treatment, kidney stones, arthritis, etc. could be the exclusions in a health insurance plan.

                in health insurance policies.

            <p><b>Injuries caused during suicidal attempts:</b>

                covered in health insurance plans by any insurance provider.
